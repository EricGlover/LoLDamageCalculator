When fully matured, Ivern can interact with the camp again to free the monsters after a 0.5-second cast time, sending them away while receiving their  full gold and  full experience bounties.  Smiting a large monster within a grove will instantly free the camp's monsters, regardless of its maturity or the monsters' current health.",

If at least one allied champion is nearby, Ivern can pick up the sapling to transfer it to the nearest one in range. If an ally kills either monster, they also leave behind a sapling that only Ivern can consume."
